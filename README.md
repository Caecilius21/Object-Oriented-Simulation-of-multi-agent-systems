# Object-Oriented-Simulation-of-multi-agent-systems
Java application allowing to simulate in a graphical way multi-agent systems. It focuses on three systems of the cellular automata type: the game of Conwayâ€™s life, a game of immigration, and the Schelling desegregation model, as well as the simulation of a self-organized swarm movement system: the Boids model.
